# Contributing to vTikz

Vtikz is under development, and is intended to be a tool to create publication worthy figures.
In order to further improve this tool, certain functionalities will be added, whilst still keeping the tool simple to use.
vTikz strives to create great figures without having to customize everything.

If there exists certain tools that you would want to be seen within the package, issue a ISSUE on [issues](https://github.com/thesombady/vTikz/issues), with the feature you want to see in the package.
If the feature is planned, I will try to implement it as fast as possible.

If you feel like you're able to implement the feature yourself, please make a pull-request of the feature.
